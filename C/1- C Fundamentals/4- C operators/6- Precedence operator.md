When a calculation contains more than one operator, C follows **order of operations** rules to decide which part to calculate first.

## Order of Operations

Here are some common operators in C, from highest to lowest priority:

- `()` - Parentheses
- `*`, `/`, `%` - Multiplication, Division, Modulus
- `+`, `-` - Addition, Subtraction
- `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` - Comparison
- `==`, `!=` - Equality
- `&&` - Logical AND
- `||` - Logical OR
- `=` - Assignment
